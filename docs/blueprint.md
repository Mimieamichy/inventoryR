## Core Features:

- Stock Initialization: Admin users can define and load initial product catalog entries (name, SKU, price, quantity). The data will be stored locally as JSON.
- Catalog Display: A responsive, searchable grid/list of available items styled with Material UI components and Tailwind utility classes.
- Sales Processing: Cashiers select items, enter quantities, and click Complete Sale to generate and display a receipt (itemized, subtotal, taxes, total, timestamp, cashier ID). The receipt will be displayed as a print-friendly HTML page.
